# Spiral
### The bio-cycle tracker for all humans

---

Spiral is a mobile application built in React Native for tracking fluctuations in physical
symptoms and mental state which may be tied to cyclical fluctuations in hormones.  In other
words, Spiral is a period tracker built for anyone, regardless of gender, designed to avoid
dysphoric triggers via gendered language and visuals. It attempts to assume nothing about
the behavior of the user's body, and only provides tools to collect and analyze data about
their body.

This application is still in very early development and is iterating fairly quickly.

See the [React Native Readme](RN_README.md) for instructions on how to get started installing
and developing within this project.
